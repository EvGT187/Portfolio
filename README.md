## About Me

My name is Evan Taylor, a current front end developer with extensive experience in CMS, UX & UI design, and the overall production behind a website. My background in web development aids in my creative and analytical flair.  I consider myself as a polymath, constantly improving my academic and practical knowledge in technological advances and developments. 

My recent exposure to data science has piqued my interest and will continue to do so, but I feel there's so much more to learn within front end web development. Wordpress has played a great role in increasing my efficiency and speed but I feel the level of abstraction has made it too easy. Going forward I would like to improve my front end skills using hands on bespoke js frameworks and hopefully Python. 

As someone who did not study pure maths in high school, I found my recent studies challenging. Learning the mathematics behind machine learning algorithms pushed me to my mental limits. It confirmed one thing, if I can learn something that extreme I can learn anything. I look forward to future learning experiences in front end and software development.

## Projects
#### Web Development
[The Concierge](https://www.the-concierge.co.za/)
The Concierge is boutique-style accommodation in my hometown, Durban. The client requested  a website that reflected the quality of the establishment as well as their services and ethos. The stock images, together with the instructions provided by the client sparked my creative insight. I immediately envisioned a quirky but luxurious theme for the website, a true reflection of the establishment.

[Mintys Fabrics](https://www.mintysfabrics.co.za/)
Minty’s Fabrics is a high end fashion and fabric boutique. They provide bespoke evening gowns, wedding dresses, luxurious fabrics and accessories. My interpretation of this particular client was whimsical yet elegant and clean, I believe I have delivered on that. 

[Sumaiya Essa](https://www.umhlangadietitian.co.za/)
Sumaiya Essa is a dietician based in Umhlanga. She has a passion for people, providing them with the best dietary directives for their well-being. I wanted to reflect her passion for people and health on the website, that's why I chose a clean layout with vibrant colours and simplified text. Fresh, exciting and to the point. 

[Frimax](https://www.frimax.co.za/)
Frimax is a well-known brand that  manufactures some of South Africa’s favourite snacks. They pride themselves in providing the best snacks for pastimes, movies, parties or just to satisfy a craving. I envisioned a vibrant website to reflect their South African pride. Snacks remind me of parties, I wanted this website to feel like one!


#### Data Science
[Automobile EDA](https://github.com/EvGT187/Automobile-EDA)
This project was an exploratory data analysis on automobile manufacturer information. The dataset contained many variables that provided clear insight into the top car manufacturers’ practices and production.


[Crunchbase EDA](https://github.com/EvGT187/Crunchbase-EDA)
The crunch base exploratory data analysis was based on financial data gained from the site in question. Crunchbase collects funding data from various tech companies that can be viewed by investors and the public alike.


[IMDB RNN](https://github.com/EvGT187/IMDB-RNN)
This recurrent neural network project is based upon a dataset from IMDB. IMDB is a site owned by Amazon that rates movies, actors, games, and other media. These ratings are publicly viewable and are used by people to find movies and gain insight into media they consider consuming.

[US Arrests PCA](https://github.com/EvGT187/US-Arrests-EDA)
This project was inspired by the recent protests against police brutality in America. I decided to take a closer look at the statistics to base my facts. A very insightful yet daunting project. Actual police murder stats aren't available, skewed and misreported as shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaD84DTGULo&t=81s&ab_channel=LastWeekTonight). So this was the next best thing.

[Titanic Tableau](https://github.com/EvGT187/Titanic-Tableau)
This project is more visualisation based project than anything else. I took this chance to use the very popular Tableau application to display the mortality rate of the Titanic cruise ship. The Tableau file and dataset can be downloaded to examine further.
